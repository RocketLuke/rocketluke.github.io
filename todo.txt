Issues:
- Add warnings for certain abilities that can brick raids, such as Competitive
- Pokemon added to your team should support multiple offensive types (ie their Tera type shouldn't necessarily determine whether or not they're effective against a pokemon)
- Build pokemon select dropdowns based off of master list rather than html
- indeedee doesn't get its psychic
- immune is correctly viewed as a resistance
- glalie doesn't get its ghost
- Seperate JS methods into categorized files

Pokémon Raid Helper

This web application was built to help determine which Pokémon one should for raids in Pokémon Scarlet & Violet.

<h2>How To Use</h2>:

This web application is divided into two parts
- Raid Finder
- Team Builder

<h3>Raid Finder</h3>
The Raid Finder view allows one to enter in information about a raid Pokémon. You can either select the Pokémon itself or its offensive type(s). Additionally, you will select the raid Pokémon's Tera Type.

Once information is entered, press the Submit button and the web application will determine which Pokémon from your team will be (likely) effective against the raid Pokémon.

<h3>Team Builder</h3>
In order to use the Raid Finder, you must first create your team of Pokémon!

This view has two parts:
1. A form for entering in new Pokémon for your team
2. A display of your current, with buttons to remove team tembers

Once you've added Pokémon to your team, you can go to the Raid Finder and determine how effective they'll (likely) be against a raid Pokémon!
